 These are the window definitions. These windows can be used for either
 FIR filter design or with an FFT for spectral analysis.
 For definitions, see this article:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function

 This function has 6 inputs
 Data is the array, of length N, containing the data to to be windowed.
 This data is either a FIR filter sinc pulse, or the data to be analyzed by an fft.

 WindowType is an enum defined in the header file.
 e.g. wtKAISER, wtSINC, wtHANNING, wtHAMMING, wtBLACKMAN, ...

 Alpha sets the width of the flat top.
 Windows such as the Tukey and Trapezoid are defined to have a variably wide flat top.
 As can be seen by its definition, the Tukey is just a Hanning window with a flat top.
 Alpha can be used to give any of these windows a partial flat top, except the Flattop and Kaiser.
 Alpha = 0 gives the original window. (i.e. no flat top)
 To generate a Tukey window, use a Hanning with 0 < Alpha < 1
 To generate a Bartlett window (triangular), use a Trapezoid window with Alpha = 0.
 Alpha = 1 generates a rectangular window in all cases. (except the Flattop and Kaiser)


 Beta is used with the Kaiser, Sinc, and Sine windows only.
 These three windows are used primarily for FIR filter design. Then
 Beta controls the filter's transition bandwidth and the sidelobe levels.
 All other windows ignore Beta.

 UnityGain controls whether the gain of these windows is set to unity.
 Only the Flattop window has unity gain by design. The Hanning window, for example, has a gain
 of 1/2.  UnityGain = true  sets the gain to 1, which preserves the signal's energy level
 when these windows are used for spectral analysis.

 Don't use this with FIR filter design however. Since most of the enegy in an FIR sinc pulse
 is in the middle of the window, the window needs a peak amplitude of one, not unity gain.
 Setting UnityGain = true will simply cause the resulting FIR filter to have excess gain.

 If using these windows for FIR filters, start with the Kaiser, Sinc, or Sine windows and
 adjust Beta for the desired transition BW and sidelobe levels (set Alpha = 0).
 While the FlatTop is an excellent window for spectral analysis, don't use it for FIR filter design.
 It has a peak amplitude of ~ 4.7 which causes the resulting FIR filter to have about this much gain.
 It works poorly for FIR filters even if you adjust its peak amplitude.
 The Trapezoid also works poorly for FIR filter design.

 If using these windows with an fft for spectral analysis, start with the Hanning, Gauss, or Flattop.
 When choosing a window for spectral analysis, you must trade off between resolution and amplitude
 accuracy. The Hanning has the best resolution while the Flatop has the best amplitude accuracy.
 The Gauss is midway between these two for both accuracy and resolution. These three were
 the only windows available in the HP 89410A Vector Signal Analyzer. Which is to say, these three
 are the probably the best windows for general purpose signal analysis.

Modifications by JRH: 4 October 2015
- reduced from original FFTCode.cpp: the FFT functions were not required by the IIR code
- replace new() and delete() functions with realloc() and free(), respectively - no need for new.h header, which was causing problems anyway
- remove requirement for vcl.h header for "ShowMessage" - just print to stderr instead
